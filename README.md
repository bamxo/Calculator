# Calculator

This calculator project includes different modules for performing mathematical operations using command-line and graphical user interface (GUI).

## Modules

### calculator.py

The `calculator.py` module contains the core logic for performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It supports both integer and floating-point calculations.

#### Usage

To use the calculator from the command line, run the following command:

```bash
python calculator.py
```

### calculatorGUI.py
The calculatorGUI.py module provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for the calculator. It allows users to input numbers via buttons and perform calculations with a visual interface.

## Usage
To launch the calculator GUI, run the following command:

```bash
python calculatorGUI.py
```
The GUI window will open, allowing you to perform calculations using the buttons.

### stack.py
The stack.py module implements a stack data structure, which is used internally by the calculator modules for evaluating expressions and handling calculations.

### tree.py
The tree.py module implements a binary expression tree data structure. It is used by the calculator modules for parsing and evaluating complex mathematical expressions.
